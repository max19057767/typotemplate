## **The use of typefaces seen on covers of biography books.**

The wide range of typefaces and their modifications in the styles of a dozen fonts, as seen on biography books, is used to convey an identity. The collection of serif or sans serif characters, their placement both on the line and the canvas of the cover, or the emphasis of individual characters through the fluctuating weight all contribute to introducing the reader to the book’s tone and its subject.

‘World Travel’ by Anthony Bourdain illustrates how typefaces enforce the identity of the author, or in the case of other biographical works, the personality of the publication’s focus. This book presents its author and title using a bold sans serif typeface, which appears monospaced. The application of evenly spaced letters conjures ideas of cohesion, and stylises the typeface to appear sleek. Due to its contemporary connotations, it hints that the book may appeal to cultural relevance. The typeface is displayed in all upper case characters, it has a consistent regular weight and contrast. Likewise, the stylistic choice of the bold condensed characteristics of this typeface can communicate the idea of status and importance, asserting a sense of an impressive presence to the reader. The author's name is bigger than the title, a sign of popularity and reader’s familiarity with the author, which further enhances the impression of an esteemed reputation. Considering the subject matter of ‘World Travel’, it can be suggested that the typeface used on the book cover shares elements commonly recognised in cookbooks and travel related publications; for instance, the prominent sans serif font with delicate contrast, which strikes the reader’s attention and invites them to read the piece of media with its versatile design.  

Contrastingly, the typeface arranged on the cover of ‘William Blake vs The World’ by John Higgs introduces the reader to a visual which exists as a juxtaposition of the previous example. Bourdain’s book deployed a strong sans serif typeface, whereas the work of Higgs utilises a script serif with high contrast letters. The reader is met with clashing styles, one embodies a firm and perhaps even dedicated, or earnest, personality (‘World Travel’); the other, portrays a buoyant nature, relieved of worries, presented in a causal tone (‘William Blake vs The World’). Furthermore, the general design of Higgs’ book inverts the appearance of the book written by Bourdain, the biography of William Blake prioritises the title whereas ‘World Travel’ focuses the reader’s attention on the author.

Typefaces can be modified and referred to as fonts, in the process to fulfill their use to empathise aspects of the text. For instance, in the books depicted names are highlighted, or styled to be different from the rest of the text. Purposefully made bigger, wider, or changed to obtain a different colour value, all aiming to strike the reader with the key focus of the book. The remaining text serves as secondary intel for the reader, informing them firstly of the subject and secondly of the context or matters concerning the subject. 

Methodical use of typefaces performs the role of reflecting subject matters, when appropriately designed typography can illustrate biographies as historical or academic. On the other hand, a different range of styles may produce a contemporary aesthetic, one which reflects trends and its high acknowledgment in popular culture. Referring back to the examples, the books are stacked and categorised under a single genre - biographies. However, like all books the same biographical works can be recognised by their sub genres. Bourndain’s biography could also be placed alongside travel books or cookbooks, whether the distinction would be made due to the book’s topic or the author’s primary profession. The typeface reflects those niches, it communicates the target audience and the tone of the book, which is a decisive element of the book’s sub genre. Is it horror? Is it romance? Is it a self-help book? Is it academic? The answers to these questions are consciously hidden in the design of the typeface used.

The cover of ‘Paper Palace’ by Miranda Cowley Heller showcases how a range of typefaces can be used without creating a visually clashing image, this cover also manages to achieve an aspect of legibility, despite its intricate design which interrupts the flow of text. 



The future readers of this book might be met with a mixture of ideas connotative to the book’s cover, the design uses a variation of stylised lower-case letters and all caps, together as well as on their own the dual use may imply different concepts of the book. The typography used on book designs can be utilised to communicate various aspects of the book, this particular design may leave the reader with a mixed idea of the book’s tone. The mixed styles are mimicked in the alternate typography, the type consists of elements which are impossible to overlook, for example a high contrast or the broad extension of certain characters. Parts of the typeface are modified through the use of italics, angling the text and as an effect of such design changing the way in which the text can be read and interpreted.

The typeface used on this cover design presents itself as elegant and precise, meanwhile challenging the common appearance of an ‘elegant’ typeface with its broad and tall characters. An example of this is the overpowering C character which takes up a lot of space, almost creating the appearance of a counter (a fully closed space inside a character), appearing stretched compared to the other characters. This visual may create a sense of dominance in readers of this book, alternatively it could appeal to the complex universe explored in the book introducing the readers to the book’s multiplex storyline from the first glance. Furthermore, there is contrast between the stressing in the characters which is repeated in their individual lines, particularly the bowls of the letters. Even with the striking contrast, the characters do not appear harsh but rather soft, obtaining a gentle flow throughout the lines. 

This design incorporates a disruptive element, creating a break in the text; nonetheless, legibility is still achieved due to the spacing of the word ‘palace’. This modification is not repeated in the first half of the title, the paper tear effect is applied on the word ‘paper’, the design opposes this interruption by making the P letter partially visible with the tear only cutting through a small portion of the letter’s counter. On one hand, the reason for why the cover remains legible to the reader is because the character already exists somewhere else on the page; therefore the typeface is familiar to the reader, along with the remaining letters of the word being visible the reader is likely to compile the letters and make out the text illustrated on the book cover. On the other hand, the letter is not broken down in a crucial part and the section which is not interrupted by the design remains to be legible. This reasoning can be applied to the modification of the second half of the title, the design spaces the second line as the A would not have achieved the desired legibility if it were partially hidden due to it being thin and not as distinctive, contrasting to the characteristics of the letter P. The element of legibility and overall comprehensiveness of a book cover design is crucial, the lack of this factor limits what the author may be trying to communicate through the book’s appearance. Additionally, as a result of illegibility the reader may misinterpret the story and face the possibility of feeling disappointed in the book, which I am sure every author wants to avoid. 



Typography can be used to achieve that desired effect of legibility, as it allows authors to illustrate their story in what may first appear as a simple element among other tools which compose a book cover; creating an effective and comprehensive, yet sometimes complex design.

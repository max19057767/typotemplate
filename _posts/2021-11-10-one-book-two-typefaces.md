## Exploring the effect of designing the same title using different typefaces with contrasting characteristics.



Taking a closer look at the first and second edition of *Film: A critical introduction*, a film studies book written by Maria Pramaggiore, it could be suggested that when introduced to this academic text readers may feel the book embodies a strong sense of a ‘two-faced’ personality.

Looking at the two editions side by side we are met with contrasting use of text, there is a clear lack of similarity in the typefaces used to display the same title. The typeface used for the first edition (books on the left in the photograph) creates an impression of softness to the overall appearance of the text, compared with the second edition, which appears harsh with its solid and sharp characters. The sense of harshness could also be an effect of the striking orange background the second edition uses, instead of the black as seen on the first edition. The academic book presents itself with a sans-serif typeface which illustrates the second edition using characters with pointed edges, a contrasting visual compared to the rounded edges of the typeface used on the first edition. Due to this particular characteristic of the font used, the typeface may appear aggressive and serious, parallel to the softness and casual appearance of the other typeface. It can be argued that the appearance of the text is a result of the weight the text is styled in; both of the editions apply a regular thickness in the typefaces used, however, the typeface used on the books on the left appears light in comparison to the books placed on the right side of the photograph, which gives the impression of being stronger and thicker. The typeface is designed to be condensed, further enhancing the sense of a dominant, and as some may possibly feel, loud typeface. Appearing solid and grounded, the connotations created by the dual application of the title may particularly be amplified by the tall x-height of the typeface used in the first edition of the book. The outcome of this characteristic creates an illusion of tightness in the presentation of the text, making the characters used in the title seem to be placed close together. Despite the equal amount of space available for the design, the title of the second edition is displayed in a manner which appears stretched and wide; with more white space visible as a result of the text being capitalised, in comparison to the lower case letters seen in the design of the first edition.



This contrast continues beyond the title, the secondary line of text visible on the spine can be examined to see the weight of the text is changed. The first edition of the academic book inherits the same regular thickness which is used in the title, whereas, the second edition modifies the text and substitutes the regular weight with thin and dainty text. The delicate typeface used makes the remaining text appear dense, amplifying the connotations introduced and elaborated on earlier.



Another thing to note is that in the photograph used to examine how typefaces are used, the spine is displayed and not the book cover. This aspect can add to the effect of how the book may be perceived by future readers, as they are only presented with a portion of the design. As mentioned in my previous articles, authors utilise the canvas of a book cover to communicate the story and any other ideas they might wish for readers to see. The spine does this too, but the space is limited and so is the communication between the author and reader. Additionally, the typeface used on a design can act as tone, if there is a change in tone then there will also be a change in the reader’s interpretation of the book. The reader will perceive the book differently even if the aspect that has been modified is small and not of high importance, in this case the change is clear and it could possibly be said that the alternation of text is more assertive when the two editions are compared side by side.

    <h2>Who I am</h2>
<p>My name is Max Kielesinska, I am a second year student at OBU studying Media, Journalism & Publishing. Before coming to university I studied journalism in college, I wanted to pursue further education in a field where I could continue to develop my creative writing skills.</p>
<br>
<p>I am living in Oxford for the duration of my university course, but in my free time I often travel. One of my favourite places which I have visited in the past was Sicily, I stayed in Catania where I tasted Sicilian cuisine for the first time. During my stay I also visited Syracuse, which is known for its rich Roman and Greek history, and a beautiful town called Taormina.</p>
<br>
<p>In the future, I wish to direct my career path towards an artistic medium meanwhile implementing the tools and knowledge I acquired in the course of my studies. I would like to return to doing art as a profession or education, rather than solely creating pieces in my free time.</p>

<h2>Where I am from</h2>
<p>I grew up in Karpacz, Poland and at the age of 10 I moved to England.</p>
<br>
<p>The two photographs below this text are of Śnieżka, a mountain positioned on the border between Czech Republic and Poland, it is also the view from my bedroom window at my home in Karpacz.</p>
<br>
<p>If you are interested in reading more about Karpacz, its geographical placement and history, I recommend reading <a href="https://www.staypoland.com/about_karpacz.htm/" target="_blank"><em>StayPoland</em>'s</a> article about the Lower Silesian town.</p>

<h2>What I like</h2>
<p>From a young age I attended creative classes, as the years passed my passion and interest in art grew. I studied art and design along with photography for two years at Sixth Form, my education shaped my future goals and aspirations and as a result of that I aim to work as an archiver. In time outside of university classes I enjoy researching and curating my favourite artists and pieces, I am working towards creating a series of zines to display my own artwork and photographs.</p>
<br><p>My university course has allowed me to explore a variety of skills, expanding my knowledge and creative capabilities. One of the skills I have picked up over the course of my studies links to my recent interest in typography, as part of my course I have started writing blog entries about the different typefaces seen on book covers, commenting on their appearance, use and effect. <a href="https://facesofbooks.netlify.app/" target="_blank">You can read my blog by clicking this text or the link below the title of this page.</a></p>

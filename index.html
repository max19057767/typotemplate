<h2>What I like</h2>
<p>From a young age I attended creative classes, as the years passed my passion and interest in art grew. I studied art and design along with photography for two years at Sixth Form, my education shaped my future goals and aspirations and as a result of that I aim to work as an archiver of a wide range of art pieces. In time outside of university classes I enjoy researching and curating my favourite artists and creative works, I am working towards creating a series of zines to display my own pieces and photographs.</p>
<br><p>My university course has exposed me and allowed me to explore a variety of skills, expanding my knowledge and creative capabilities. One of the skills I have picked up over the course of my studies links to my recent interest in typography, as part of my course I have started writing blog entries about the different typefaces seen on book covers, commenting on their appearance, use and effect.</p>

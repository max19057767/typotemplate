Welcome to the About page.



##### The blog & author: 

This blog aims to inform about the range and versatility of typefaces used on a diverse collection of books, analysing the use of typography both on the inside and outside sections of publications.

The author, Max Kielesinska, is a second year student at OBU studying Media, Journalism & Publishing. Interested in typography, Max is keen to share their perspective on various book cover designs and applications of typefaces. 

##### The blog’s content:

All imagery displayed on this blog has been photographed/designed by Max Kielesinska, unless otherwise stated.

The logo visually interprets the name of the blog, combining an illustration of a book with a face on the cover. The illustration is overlaid with the name of the blog displayed in a black circle, written in the same typeface as the one used for the body text. Additionally, the logo incorporates the colour scheme that is used throughout the blog, for instance, in the article headers. All these elements are used with the intention of creating a sense of cohesion, these elements also aim to portray a clear idea of what this blog offers.

The background photo seen on the homepage of the blog is a photograph taken by the author in a bookstore, the photograph depicts two book covers with contrasting typefaces. This photograph serves as an introduction to the content of the blog, without outlining any specifics, anyone viewing the blog can immediately see the effect of different typefaces and how they convey a wide spectrum of ideas.

In order to avoid a use of a crowded background image for the article headers, the author designed a minimalistic title header. The intention of this design is to creatively communicate what the articles are about, the repeated use of the same colour scheme as the one seen in the logo embraces Faces of Books’ brand image.
